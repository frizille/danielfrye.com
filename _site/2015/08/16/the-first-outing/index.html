    <p>I’ve been asked several times to take the car up to the local car show, Caffeine and Exotics. C&amp;E is an invite only show intended to include only the really interesting or exotic stuff; no stock BMWs, Minis, or Mustangs. Feeling like the car was in a good enough state to take out, I signed up at the last minute and was quite excited about taking it out for its grand viewing – nobody other than a few friends had really seen it.</p>

<p>Sunday morning Kim and I hopped in and off we went. No major issues with the car, the idle was doing its odd thing, but able to be driven fine. As we were approaching the intersection of West Paces and Habersham I got in the left lane to turn and knowing the blinkers weren’t hooked up yet didn’t bother turning them on. It just so happens a police car then pulled up through the light and slowed down next to us as we waited to turn. Kim looked at me and said “He’s going to give you a ticket for no turn indicators.” I didn’t say anything, just thought to myself “shit.”</p>

<p>So the cop pulls up, rolls down his window, looks at us, and says… “Man, that’s a sweeettttt ride.” I look at him, look at Kim, look back at him and say “Thanks!”. There was a sudden break in traffic so before he can think twice about pulling us over I just hit the gas and made the left! Kim and I just started laughing after that.</p>

<p>The event was fun, tons of people asking about the car, and it was great to get it out for a bit. I took a couple quick pictures to commemorate it.</p>
