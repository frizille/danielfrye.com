<meta name="description" content="As others have done before me, I decided to go the route of using the bighead fasteners rather than bolting through the fiberglass for the front wings. My package of fasteners arrived today; QTY 8 SB32-CableTyrap-15. Note, the website has the 12mm bigheads but you want the 15mm ones. I sent an email to Szilard Lakatos via their website and he was able to get me the 15mm ones with no problem. The only minor issue I have is the FS Acrylic bonding agent isn’t exportable from the UK to the States so will need to find something locally." />
