<p>Next up was getting the rear anti-roll bar (RARB) assembled and into place. First thing to do is get the orange bushes stretched over the corners of the bar. They are tight! Holy crap tight! After pulling on them a bit with no luck, we then moved to soaking them in hot water with some dish soap added. They seemed to be a lot more pliable after, and a few squirts of Dawn along with a screwdriver prying them from underneath got them around the corners and into place. It was as tough as I’d read about in other blogs; just take it slow and apply lots of dish soap and you’re good to go (we had no rubber lubricant).</p>

<p> </p>

<p>When installing the RARB, make sure to install them with the arms facing down. It takes a bit of maneuvering, but if you don’t you’ll end up with them blocked by the calipers. Thankfully we’d just test fitted the caliper and popped it right off.</p>

<p>This is what you want.</p>

<p>We also used a hydraulic jack and a hockey puck to lift up the DeDion tube when we needed to align things. It seemed to work out ok to get clearance from the chassis on a couple occasions.</p>

<p>Next up was the A frame attachment. This went pretty smooth, except we left out the plastic washers in the back since we couldn’t find them. Of course we found them after the fact and went back and installed them properly. You have to centralize the A frame in the suspension; ours took 3 thick washers on one side, 4 on the other, similar to the diff install. It’s not too horrible to do, but like the diff, you’ll be adding and subtracting washers several times. An extra set of hands was key to getting it done simply.</p>

<p>With the suspension largely in place we moved to the brake discs, pads, and calipers. <a href="http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2015-01-01-15.53.51.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-662" src="http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2015-01-01-15.53.51.jpg" alt="Right side caliper and disc" width="4128" height="2322" srcset="http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2015-01-01-15.53.51.jpg 4128w, http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2015-01-01-15.53.51-300x169.jpg 300w, http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2015-01-01-15.53.51-768x432.jpg 768w, http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2015-01-01-15.53.51-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2015-01-01-15.53.51-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 4128px) 100vw, 4128px" /></a></p>

<p>Once complete we were at a stopping point. I didn’t have the 41mm socket or a torque wrench capable of the 270 NM we needed to hit so just called it a day and got lunch. Before we left we put on some wheels just to see what it looked like… technically we have a roller (kinda).</p>

<p>Lots of good progress today. Once the engine bits I need get here I think things will move pretty quickly.</p>
