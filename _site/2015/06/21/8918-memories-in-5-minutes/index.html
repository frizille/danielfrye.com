    <p>Now that the car is mostly done (just need to wire the headlights, attach the weather gear, and fix the speed-o ground wire which failed over the weekend) I sat down yesterday and assembled the time lapse video. From a timeline perspective, the build started September 26, 2014 and “ended” June 7, 2015. Over the course of 42 ‘build days’, I put in just over 148 hours of time and captured 8,918 pictures.

<p>Technical specs: Capture was done with a GoPro Hero 3 set for a wide angle 12mp capture every 60 seconds. Editing was done with GoPro’s Studio something-or-other software which I was less than thrilled with. Music courtesy of Social Distortion’s <em>Story of My Life</em> from the album <em>Live at the Roxy</em>.</p>
