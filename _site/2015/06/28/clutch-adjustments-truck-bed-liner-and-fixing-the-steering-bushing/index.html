    <p>It’s been a couple weeks since the car has been “done” but had a few issues to take care of since. Rather than post a whole bunch of posts I’m doing just one with the highlights from the last week and a half or so.</p>

<p>First up was putting on the correct shift knob that Caterham sent. I had been sent a silver 5-speed knob with the car but had a 6-speed transmission. Derek was kind enough to send on my choice of color for the 6-speed knob; the black looks great and better than the silver in my opinion!</p>

<p>Next up was dealing with the oil leak from the first drives. After wiping down the motor and getting it clean, I gave the engine a start and let it run for a bit while watching the left side of the motor. What I found is the oil isn’t coming from the side of the block, but through the oil pressure sender which I’ll admit, I did not wrap in teflon tape. So out with the box end wrench, removed pressure sender, wrapped in teflon, then re-attached. A tiny bit of oil dribbled out but wasn’t enough to really worry about. Cleaned that up, retested, and no oil leak.</p>

<p>The other fix was to re-attach the upper steering bushing; you can see below how far it had worked itself out because the rubber knobs weren’t properly located into the dash during the build. I removed the steering wheel using a 3-prong puller then followed another build blog’s advice of using a small piece of 3/4″ PVC pipe slid over the steering column to tap the bushing into the dash. Home Depot had a 2′ section of 3/4″ pipe for $3 which worked perfect along with liberal use of silicone lubricant and a rubber mallet.</p>

<p>Another add was to coat the underside of the rear and front fiberglass wings with truck bed liner. The process went fine, but two notes – 1) that stuff STINKS so make sure you do it where there is ventilation and 2) that stuff gets EVERYWHERE. DO NOT TOUCH THE CAR WHILE WORKING ON THE WINGS. I was diligent and thankfully didn’t have an issue but did get some smudges on wings themselves. Water and a rag will get them off while the paint is wet, once dry though, it’s never coming off.</p>

<p>After driving the car a tad more I realized I was going to need to adjust the clutch pedal for a longer throw. I remembered reading a bit about this on <a href="https://fernlahone.wordpress.com/2013/05/28/601/">Dave Fernlahone’s blog and his instructions were perfect</a>. Getting your hands down into the footwell with a couple wrenches through the top access panel is a pain in the ass though, plan on taking a couple hours for such a simple job. Pics below of the footwell and the locknuts to adjust. The handwritten diagram on Dave’s site explains things really well.</p>

<p>Lastly, I’m having problems with hitting the gas when I mean to hit the brake. The brake and the gas are so close together I almost have to drive barefoot (I did, it’s much easier without shoes). To that end I bought a new pair of driving shoes; Piloti Prototipo. However, even with those the pedals are still too close for my feet and they aren’t that big – US size 9. As a result, I also <a href="http://www.academy.com/shop/pdp/nike-adults-davinho-indoor-soccer-shoes/pid-672107?N=619714336&amp;count=3&amp;affcode=42&amp;kwid=ps_cse&amp;cid=PLA_023570773&amp;kwid=productads-plaid%5E136813814718-sku%5E023570773-adType%5EPLA-device%5Ec-adid%5E69707526198">ordered a pair of Nike Davinho’s</a> which are very narrow indoor soccer shoes with a thin rubber sole. Will see how they work next time I go out.</p>
