    <h4 id="monday-march-16-2020">Monday, March 16, 2020</h4>

<p>I honestly don’t remember much of the week in detail. My brain had two warring halves which oscillated between “holy shit, the stock market is in freefall and the money I need to launch this startup has now been cut in half” and “holy shit, I’m failing, we’re going to fail, I need to get this business model figured out”.</p>

<p>My mood was generally positive, all things considering, although I’m sure my wife would disagree. It’s self-evident that I’m biased of course.</p>

<p>Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday were meeting free and was heads down writing a business plan. As a diversion, I also did some creative work by writing a website of sorts just so we could get a little page out there with who we were. The website turned out pretty good, but realized Tuesday night that I was using the website “work” as a substitute for the harder, and more important, work of coming up with the business plan.</p>

<p>I chose to follow the business plan documenting model I’d done for my prior company when I did an evaluation of its AWS business right before I left. Essentially, the model is to take the nine-section CANVAS methodology and record the relevant details for each section in it. Customer segments, value proposition, cost model, revenue model, key resources, and so on. <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure></p>

<p>It’s a handy way to keep your mind focused on the respective quadrants of a business. All of them need to work in concert, so it’s easy to jump within the doc referencing separate sections as necessary and to edit / update / provide more detail as you build the business model.</p>

<p>The important thing here is that you aren’t just building the model off what you think, but that you’re referencing outside data to prove points. It’s a business model on one hand, but also a research paper of sorts on the other. I would argue that the research paper portion of it is more important than the business model, otherwise you’re in imagination land and your business will likely fail. Note, it’s sometimes hard to see where that line starts and stops – it’s a blurry image in most cases because you’re dealing with unpredictable events and humans.</p>

<p>Mike and I met for our first Zoom meeting of the year on Thursday. It was originally supposed to be over a beer, but the sudden and massive swell of Coronavirus events precluded that. Mike and I chatted for about an hour and I walked him through what I was thinking in terms of the business model, product, and how we’d go about reducing customer pain and providing new gains with our solution.</p>

<p>Mike’s feedback was that the business still felt a bit soft. I agreed with him once I got through an hours’ worth of dialog with him. I felt like I should have things more solidified after spending the entire week trying to clearly articulate it in a document, and think I did feel rigidness in some respects, but there was a nagging feeling of mushiness there overall. I resolved to dig back into it on Friday and keep iterating.</p>

<p>Thursday night I got the chance to talk to one of the guys who used to work for me at my prior company. We worked together just shy of a decade and knew each other pretty well. He reminds me a lot of me.</p>

<p>Given the pandemic, we had to cancel our beer in person and opted to chat via phone instead. It was good to catch up and chat. I didn’t really get to say goodbye when I left given my schedule and his, plus my head was somewhere else in trying to process the huge life change I was going through, but all’s well that ends well.</p>

<p>Interestingly, he told me that he was leaving the company as well. I wasn’t overly surprised. I suspected that he was ready to make a leap to something new a couple years ago but had settled into routine and that’s hard to break out of when you’re making a good-but-not-great salary, have a lot of flexibility with your hours and working remotely, and get to work on fun technical projects regularly.</p>

<p>I offered him what little advice I had from my journey these past few weeks, wished him well, and told him to stay in touch and holler if he ever needed anything. I also ordered him a copy of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Your-Life-Well-Lived-Joyful/dp/1101875321" target="_blank">Designing Your Life</a> on Amazon as a parting thank you gift for all the great work he’s done for me over the years thinking that it was helpful to me, and since he and I are a lot alike, might be useful for him too.</p>

<p>Friday I met with Cynthia, the executive recruiter from GA Tech, as a continuation of our conversation from the CDL event. She and I commented on how crazy things were, how life was about to change significantly for a lot of people <em>[EDIT: Hindsight 20/20, understatement of the year]</em>, and where I was with the business. She said I should reach out to a couple people in our MBA class that might be able to provide some good information and some contacts she had. I made some notes and would follow up with them in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a pretty busy week and had high energy throughout. The pandemic stuff seems like its getting a bit nutty, surely it can’t be this bad and this is all overblown, but I guess it is what it is. At this point I’ve just accepted the stock market is going to be down a lot. I was somewhat fortunate that I sold out of Disney stock in January and put my money into Microsoft and Apple, thinking that surely they wouldn’t be dropping any time soon, but … oh well.</p>

<p>I seem to be making progress on the business and the market will come back eventually.</p>
