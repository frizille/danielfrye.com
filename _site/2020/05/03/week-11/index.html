<p>Monday morning. As I sat down at the computer with my coffee and started my day, I was reminded by something a friend told me over the weekend – “every day feels like a Monday morning when you’re running your own business”. Great observation.</p>

<p>The very first email I read was from Create-X letting us know we didn’t get in. I wasn’t surprised – I really flubbed that pitch to the interview panel. It was disappointing all the same though.</p>

<p>After giving it some thought, I came to realize that my disappointment wasn’t because we lost a business opportunity, it was that if we had gotten into Create-X, then it would be a sort of personal validation, for me at least, that we were on the right track or that someone saw <em>potential</em> in us.</p>

<p>That was a powerful realization and led me to look at the positive side of not getting into the program.</p>

<p>First, the reality is the $4,000 they were going to give us doesn’t amount to anything substantial. I could pay myself back the $700 or so bucks I’ve spent in the last couple weeks to get the company paperwork filed, get email setup, buy domain names, and so on, but it does’t materially move the needle or enable me to pay my mortgage.</p>

<p>Second, taking several days each week for twelve weeks to be active in the program would distract us from doing the immediate and necessary work of writing code, preparing for product-market fit, and preparing a pitch deck. The program could have been helpful in raising awareness of the company, but at the possible detriment to our real priorities.</p>

<p>Third, we would likely have been assigned McGreggor as our mentor and the reality is he had already offered his help whenever we needed it, we just needed to reach out to him whenever we needed guidance.</p>

<p>So with that said, we were better off proceeding alone for the time being. The only real challenge was finding that personal validation I was craving. We had been told no a lot in the last two years. It was starting to wear on me.</p>

<p>I really needed to hear a yes.</p>

<p>The rest of Monday was uneventful. I spent most of the day working on writing the NSF proposal and did a little reading about the stock market and earnings. Lots of companies report this week. I was tempted to move some money from Apple to Tesla, but Tesla is already close to its 52-week high and Apple is the safe play for now given they will likely release a lower tier phone this fall and will also be bringing 5G capability to their phones. I suspect Apple will see outsized revenues compared to prior years and I don’t think all of those revenues are priced into the stock given the short term concern about the pandemic and supply chain disruption.</p>

<p>Writing is funny. When you get into the groove, you make great progress. When you’re not in the groove, it is a muddy uphill slog. Yesterday was a combination of both. At some point in the day I finally convinced my brain to stop fighting for perfection and just get words on paper. The net result was three pages I’m comfortable with. They still need another review and to be picked apart, but at least some of the foundation is built. I felt like I should have more material after a half day’s hard work, but the reality is I probably wrote close to ten pages of stuff during the process. I wonder if there’s some kind of counter in Word that’ll tell you how much you really typed? I’m curious yet scared at the same time.</p>

<p>Over the last two weeks, I’ve watched a couple webinars that were about tips and tricks for submitting a successful NSF Phase 1 proposal. The speaker in one of the webinars I watched mentioned that the NSF wants to see patents filed for the innovation for which you’re getting funding. We don’t have the roughly $30,000 necessary to file a patent now. We added it to our budget request for funding so we could file once (if) we get funding, however, we can file a provisional patent now for about $200. <em>[EDIT: I later found out that you can’t use NSF funds for IP protection. I also talked to a lawyer, and it is roughly $700 to file a non-provisional through a law firm. The patent cost of $30,000 was accurate in a broad stroke.]</em></p>

<p>Provisional patents work like this: You file a provisional patent application (PPA), along with written support for your invention, to the US Patent Office. The US Patent Office files the PPA for 12 months, they don’t review them, and essentially gives you title to the invention while you are working out commercialization, product-market fit, and writing the formal non-provisional patent application (i.e. spending that $30,000 on a patent lawyer).</p>

<p>The PPA is essentially a way to file a placeholder with the patent office while you get everything else in order. The fees are low enough that even if you don’t file the non-provisional patent for whatever reason, you’re not out that much cost and expense. I think that might be the right thing to do for us. I’ve got a call into our lawyer to get his opinion so I’ll see what he says then go from there.</p>

<p>Tuesday morning I was thinking about the “I really needed to hear a yes” comment I wrote in Monday’s update. Why did I need to hear a yes? I know the idea is good and I know that this is something many, many other people would appreciate. I’ve never met anyone who was like “I &lt;3 passwords”. So why the long face?</p>

<p>I think the answer lies in the pressure I was putting on myself. I stopped looking at the journey as something I want to do, that I’m excited to do, and instead replaced those positive feelings with fear. It became something I have to overcome, and the more I strive to overcome it, the more power I give that fear.</p>

<p>I am stubborn – just ask my wife. My stubbornness is a source of strength and grit, but it comes at great cost. I become moody, irritable, and a rather cantankerous sort of louse that casts a shadow just by being present. Frankly, I kinda turn into a big asshole that sits quietly in the corner fuming and mumbling to himself.</p>

<p>What I’m curious about though, is why do I go to that place? You can have grit without being an asshole, depressed, or generally living within a blanket of fear. I’m not sure what’s going on in that brain of mine. I’ll have to keep pondering that…</p>

<p>Tuesday night, I met with Paul and Tom in our weekly company status call. The call lasted a couple hours and we went through the NSF proposal in detail. There’s a lot of work we need to do before we’re ready to submit, and we need to submit soon because we need the cash as a lifeline, so this is now top of the pile in terms of priority.</p>

<p>After spending all day, and I mean all day, I felt like I had something starting to come together on Wednesday night. Chalk it up to almost eighteen hours of writing, but I had three good pages. Or so I hoped of course, the real test would be when we send it out for review.</p>

<p>Speaking of review, one of the things we discussed at length in our Tuesday night meeting was how we could vet this thing before we officially submit. We’re first time entrepreneurs, we’ve never written for a grant before, and generally are still trying to flush out the business model and hone in on <em>exactly</em> what we’re building and why.</p>

<p>Visually put, I had this:</p>

<div class="wp-block-image">
  <figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://powerpivotpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/upload-2.png" alt="" /></figure>

<p>We needed this:</p>

<div class="wp-block-image">
  <figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://sparkpeo.hs.llnwd.net/e4//nw/4/7/l474657998.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
</div>

<p>The way we tackled it was through a multi-pronged approach.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Reach out to McGreggor and ask him to review. We could count on him to be bluntly honest with us, we learned that in class for nine months. If it passed the McGreggor test, then that was good sign that we hadn’t made any huge logic errors in our business model and go-to-market strategy.</li>
  <li>I’m a competent business writer. I thought I was a good writer at one point in my life, then I worked for an amazing CFO who regularly shredded my writing with redlines. I very quickly learned there is a big difference between <em>good writing</em> and <em>exceptional executive writing</em> when it comes to passivity, grammar, and indirect and unsupported conclusions. To make sure we had the most compelling proposal we could generate, we enlisted the help of a proposal writer I used to work with. She offered to trade time quid pro quo which worked great for us.</li>
  <li>Reach out to ATDC’s proposal staff and ask them for some help. I had a webinar scheduled for Thursday, put on by ATDC’s NSF proposal coordinator, and planned to contact her afterwards to see if she knew of any free or paid resources we could leverage to read our proposal under the guise of what an NSF panelist would look for.</li>
  <li>Pass a copy over to Mike and have him review as our official-unofficial advisor to the company.</li>
  <li>Gather as much information as possible on why proposals were disquilified or if there were any tips or tricks we could find from successful proposals. In other words, what are the NSF panelists really looking for?</li>
</ol>

<p>We figured if we did those five things, we’d have a better than average shot at putting in a quality proposal, with sound business logic, and a compelling technology that would warrant a grant from the NSF.</p>

<p>Or so we hoped.</p>

<p>The webinar on Thursday, with ATDC’s proposal coordinator, Connie, was helpful. I reached out to her afterwards with a few questions, to which she replied almost immediately, and got us pointed in the right direction. Her guidance was this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure to redact the proposal for any proprietary information.</li>
  <li>She didn’t know of any proposal editors that could specifically review in terms of what the NSF is looking for, but did say there are some consultants out there and that it’s kind of a niche industry.</li>
  <li>With regard to my specific questions about our business model and what we planned on putting into the doc, we were going about our preparation the right way and thinking in the right frame of mind.</li>
</ul>

<p>What I got from the interaction with Connie is that we weren’t as bad off as I had feared. We were viewing the proposal through the same prism as an NSF reviewer and were asking good questions. Her comment about redaction was timely – we hadn’t considered that aspect of the proposal and so had a “oh shit, why didn’t we think of that” moment.</p>

<p>I’ll count that as one crocodile eliminated from the pond.</p>

<p>Friday was spent writing in the morning and then had planned to attend a webinar put on by NSF about the proposal process at 2:00 PM. The webinar was not, in any way, what I expected and was one of the best things I spent time on during the proposal preparation process.</p>

<p>The webinar started with 15 minutes of prepared remarks and slides from the speaker. Then the meeting was opened up for Q&amp;A. The Q&amp;A lasted for over three hours! Many of the questions I knew the answers for, having read the PAPPG and proposal solicitation cover to cover several times, but there was a lot of context that those documents left out.</p>

<p>The most insightful bit of knowledge from the webinar was the use of Letters of Support in the proposal. A Letter of Support is exactly that – it’s a letter written from a potential customer, investor, industry analyst, or some other authoritative source about your idea. What the Letter is meant to do is demonstrate that there is a market demand for this innovation, that its been vetted within the industry through customer discovery data, and that it’s valued. It is NOT a rubber stamp saying “if these guys make this, I’ll buy it”. The Letters need to talk more about the “why this idea” rather than “I support this idea”.</p>

<p>Originally, we looked at the Letter of Support, hidden in a subclause and buried in the PAPPG and the solicitation for proposals, as just another “if you have it great, if you don’t, that’s fine too” kind of thing. Easily bypassed and ignored.</p>

<p>We ended up pursuing, and obtaining, three outstanding Letters of Support as a result of realizing their importance from the webinar.</p>

<p>Cross off another crocodile.</p>

<p>The week ended with a final thought that was inspired by a blog post I read – <a href="https://breakout.careers/advice/how-to-get-a-job-at-a-startup/?utm_source=angellist">Is it time to earn or learn</a>? One of the things that I’ve been struggling with these past many weeks has been the notion that I’m throwing money away on a foolish idea that will never work. What I’ve come to realize is that it’s not failure of the idea that worries me, it’s the loss of money that has no return. I am hyper obsessed with not having enough money to retire on, in other words, its a fear of future scarcity.</p>

<p>What the article helped me realize, is that this journey is about current growth, at the expense of current and possibly future wealth. In other words, I’m not doing this because I hope one day to get rich on a company I started, but rather because I haven’t hit the rev limiter on my motor yet. There is still untapped potential in me, both in the amount I can learn and the amount I can do with that knowledge, and it’s the notion of not growing that motivates me onward, over the fear of future scarcity. The stress I feel is the battle between those two motivators.</p>
