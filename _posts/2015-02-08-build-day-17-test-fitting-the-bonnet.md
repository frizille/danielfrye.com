After getting the engine in and posting some pictures of progress to Facebook, Randy suggested test fitting the bonnet since it looked really close to not fitting. When I got home from work tonight I put the bonnet on, and sure enough, its sitting directly on the oil cap and still has a pretty significant gap on the edges.

A picture of the gap between the chassis and the bonnet.

With the bonnet issueÂ identified, I went about getting the alternator attached only to find out I&#8217;m missing the bolts necessary. The brackets went on easy enough, but didn&#8217;t have the longer bolt and nut necessary so just hung it there loosely. I also shot an email off to Jon at Caterham USA about the engine fitment. Had we done something wrong with the engine mounts?
