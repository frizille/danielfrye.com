#### Monday, July 27, 2020

Things are going fast. I feel like we&#8217;re a snowball, rolling down the mountain, getting bigger with every rotation. Everything we do seems to gather momentum. Well, let me rephrase. _Much of what we do_ seems to gather momentum. That&#8217;s both reassuring, but also kind of scary. It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m carrying the worry that the music will stop, or we&#8217;ll do something very dumb. I&#8217;m trying very hard not to do anything dumb. 

Monday morning was our first daily development stand up meeting with eight people. Eight. It felt crowded. After months of just a few of us, eight feels like a hell of a lot.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

I chatted with Paul after the call and we both commented on how amazing it is that we have seven other people that have joined us on this journey with no salary and no promise of equity in the company. All they want is the opportunity to be part of something pretty cool and to learn. I remember Mark Suster&#8217;s article, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bothsidesofthetable.com/is-it-time-for-you-to-earn-or-to-learn-34270acd2f4" target="_blank">Is it Time for You to Earn or to Learn</a>, and guess there are folks out there that understand what Mark was getting at. Here&#8217;s what our growth vs cash burn rate looks like.

With that said, we&#8217;re likely to lose Ben and Justin in the next few weeks when they head back to school, Josh could get a job at any time, and the rest of the guys will continue to contribute as they&#8217;re able around their own work, school, and family commitments. So we don&#8217;t have full time developers, but I&#8217;m wondering if we have something more important &#8211; people with passion.

One of the things that Paul and I wanted most for the folks that join us, as interns, employees, or in any other capacity, is the opportunity to grow. We&#8217;re kind of a bunch of scrappy underdogs. 

I like it.

So Monday&#8230; it was pretty uneventful. I spent the morning getting the new guys, Dean, Isaiah, and Justin, setup with accounts and access. A little about the guys:

  * Dean is a registered nurse that wanted to learn more about development because he wants to start a healthcare company that creates devices purpose built for elderly patients. He met Jon at the GA Tech coding bootcamp and Jon recommended him to us. I was struck by Dean&#8217;s passion for the elderly care aspect and thought to myself, why not? I can help this guy learn more about business, development, and maybe one day he can make a company that will help my parents. During the interview I made a commitment to help him on his learning journey and he made a commitment to follow that passion to build the company he wants.
  * Isaiah was a heating/AC tech that dabbled in computers. Then he decided why dabble? Why not try it as a career. He decided to take the GA Tech bootcamp, met Jon, and now he&#8217;s taking the opportunity with us to get his first taste of programming as a career.
  * Justin was recommended to us from Mark, one of our original capstone compatriots. Justin had done an internship with Mark&#8217;s company over the summer, and after that wrapped up, Justin was killing time until school started. Mark made the introduction to us, we brought Justin onboard this week. Justin programs computer games in his spare time, obviously a kindred spirit to me, and he and I hit it off pretty quickly.

After the guys were settled and we had them paired up with Ben, Josh, and Jon, I spent a couple hours working some exercises for the Venture Deals class. Learning doesn&#8217;t stop, even as CEO. The exercises in question were on liquidation preferences and participating / non-participating share calculations. The basics are this &#8211; as a VC, always get high multiples for liquidation and don&#8217;t cap your participating shares. As a founder, do the opposite.

I also talked to Tom and Paul half a dozen times each on the phone, par for the course, and then spent some time with Jon and Isaiah going over the latest iteration of the website. Current disposition below.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

It&#8217;s come a far way from last week&#8217;s wireframe.

I was in a writing mood Monday night so spent some time catching up on writing the blog posts here. I skipped weeks 14-19 prior, just too busy, and wanted to get my thoughts down before I forget the details. I was able to knock out weeks 14 and 15 Monday night while watching Spaceballs and Tron.

On Tuesday we had the daily standup, we dished out tasks, and then I started cranking on my to do list. I had a few big items that I wanted to knock out:

  * Get captable.io setup so we could issue Ben and Josh shares in the company officially. Paul, Tom, and I all felt that they each deserved some equity given the work they were doing. 
  * There were two articles I read late Monday night, one on Burn Rate and another on Being in the Wilderness, which I sent out to Tom and Paul. both articles were very good. We are entering the Wilderness period &#8211; that time when development is in full swing and before you have any customers. It&#8217;s a somewhat lonely place to be because you really don&#8217;t know if what you&#8217;re building will actually work. It&#8217;s somewhat a leap of faith. With that said, however, we are still talking to customers about what we&#8217;re building but it&#8217;s hard to articulate it without something to demo to them. 

I spent some time working on writing up the stock plan in the afternoon and sent the SaaS click-through T&Cs document to Arn for review. I also did some more writing on weeks 16-18 on here so I can hopefully get caught up this week. It&#8217;s a small goal in the grand scheme of things, but feel like I&#8217;ve got a little leeway this week to get it done since the majority of the work is falling on the development side of the house right now.

Tuesday night I spent a few hours doing more writing &#8211; it never occurred to me exactly how much work these are to write when you&#8217;re trying to do them in retrospective two months after the fact.

Paul came over on Wednesday and we spent the morning doing the daily standup, working through customer onboarding design and a few architectural tasks, and then took a break to go get mexican for lunch. It seems we do mexican every week for whatever reason. After lunch and after Paul headed home, I made a trip to Costco and ran errands to beat the rush. It was uneventful and relatively deserted which was great. 

Wednesday night I took a break from work and made two racks of lamb on the Red Egg (Kamado Joe). [The recipe is here on the site](http://danielfrye.com/2020/07/30/rack-of-lamb/) and it came out quite good! 

Tom, Paul, and I had our weekly Cofounders Call Wednesday night instead of Tuesday this week. The agenda was fairly light &#8211; mostly just talking through the stock plan, the documents I had in progress, and where we were at financially ($200 in the bank), and where development was at. I think the call lasted about an hour &#8211; relatively quick call. No word yet on NSF. 

The only real output from the call was the agreement that we want to apply to YCombinator and the Venture Atlanta Conference. Getting into both will be a challenge, but what&#8217;s the worst that can happen&#8230; we hear a no? After the call I did some reading about how to design a sales process ([The Sales Acceleration Formula](https://www.amazon.com/Sales-Acceleration-Formula-Technology-Inbound/dp/1119047072)) and then called it a night.

Thursday morning was pretty light, just the daily stand up call, but the afternoon made up for it. There was a webinar put on by AWS and YC (YCombinator) talking about how to make a good application. Knowing that we were headed in that direction, I thought it a good idea to attend in the same way that getting on the NSF SBIR webinars was a good idea. Those proved useful so figured this would as well.

I&#8217;m happy to report I was correct &#8211; it was very useful. The biggest thing I got from the webinar is this &#8211; YC wants you to be direct and real. No marketing bullshit, no MBA nonsense, just be real. Talk about the opportunity, how you&#8217;re approaching it, and what problem you&#8217;re really trying to solve. I think we check all the boxes in terms of our approach, but time will tell when we apply. Applications are due mid-September so I marked my calendar to be done by September 1st.

After the YC webinar, I had a Startup School group session with three other random CEOs. Startup School is like YC-lite, if such a thing existed. One CEO was from Nigeria and was starting a logistics company of sorts. He had a thick accent, and it was hard to understand him a bit through the Webex, but what I gathered from him is that he was the &#8220;Uber of errands&#8221;. Let&#8217;s say you are a single mom and need to watch the kids but also go to the store &#8211; just open the app and put in your request and someone (the equivalent to an Uber driver) will go do it for you. I question the cost mechanics, but maybe there&#8217;s different cost-price dynamics in a developing country versus the US.

The second CEO was from New York and was starting a security company focused on API security. This was immensely interesting to me since this literally had just come up last week with DJ and James. The CEO didn&#8217;t go into too many details, but said that they were working on product and looking for their initial customers. He mentioned doctor&#8217;s offices and lawyers&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s the right market for them. I don&#8217;t know of any doctor&#8217;s offices and lawyers that need API security. He also wasn&#8217;t sure what his other competitors were, he mentioned Cisco and FireEye, but &#8230; no. At least not that I know of. I think they have some more work to do on market analysis in my opinion.

The third CEO was no show, no idea what they did.

The feedback on Rocketanksy was positive. They understood what we were doing, why we were doing it, and seemed to like what we were putting together. I was a bit cagey on details and over simplified many of the points&#8230; I still don&#8217;t trust most people to know the detailed mechanics of our business model, even though it is as-yet unproven. 

Friday morning we did the usual 10AM meeting and had a demo day of sorts where each person showed off what they had been working on. The most profound part of the meeting was when Josh showed off the iPhone app doing an authentication! It works&#8230; mostly. Before today it was dying at step 4, even though steps 5-8 we&#8217;re working fine. So now that step 4 is fixed, it goes all the way to step 9. There&#8217;s 10 steps so we&#8217;re close. So very, very close! It&#8217;ll be great to see an authentication work for the first time.

Bearing in mind that we have no idea yet if it&#8217;s secure or what it costs us to actually perform an authentication. Both of those things could completely destroy our company or business model if we let them. 

After the standup, I started working on transitioning all of our Trello tasks to Asana and getting Asana boards setup. With nine of us working on the company &#8211; holy shit we have nine people(!!!) &#8211; and having us divided up into different teams task-focused on the front end, back end, IOS agent, and Windows agent, not counting the three cofounders as a separate team working on business tasks related to getting funding and running the business, we had outgrown the Trello board and coordination was getting muddy. I&#8217;ve heard from several other CEOs that they followed the same progression &#8211; form company > Trello > grow in staff > outgrow Trello > move to Asana. My advice to anyone out there following in our footsteps, just start with Asana. I hate to say that though because I really do like the simplicity of Trello and have been a long time user.

We also talked about setting up Read-the-Docs (RTD) as a documentation repository. RTD will pull in your code from git and then build a documentation shell around it which would be helpful for us. We aren&#8217;t using Github, Gitlab, or Bitbucket, the only platforms they integrate with, so we&#8217;ll need to copy the code repo over to Bitbucket for it to work. I made the comment that using Bitbucket is an extra step, but not a bad thing, since we&#8217;ll end up with a secondary code repository in the event that something were to happen to CodeCommit in AWS, however unlikely that is.

After that I spent some time thinking about Stripe, Square, and credit card processing. I chatted with Paul mid-day and got his thoughts on skipping credit cards as a form of payment initially and just sticking with invoices. 

My logic is this: 

  * First, Stripe, using it as a stereotype of all merchants we might use, charges us a set fee of about 3%, plus $.30 cents, for every transaction we run. The reality is that if we&#8217;re talking about using a per authentication model, we could have some users that never clear the $.30 cent hurdle and we&#8217;d lose money by actually having them pay us if they did less than 33 authentications. So there&#8217;s some kind of pricing minimum we need to set.
  * Second, if we&#8217;re doing business-to-business sales, then there&#8217;s no reason we can&#8217;t send invoices out to customers and have them pay with Net 30 terms. Some companies may not want to use credit cards at all and require us to invoice their accounts payable team directly.
  * Third, for our initial customers of lets say 50, we can generate the 50 invoices by hand and email them out. It&#8217;s not that much work that would have to be automated. With 1,000 small business customers, then yeah, we might need to take some credit cards. So we don&#8217;t need the automated capability initially &#8211; that means it&#8217;s not in scope for the prototype or MVP.
  * Fourth, I don&#8217;t want to give up 3% of our revenue! I can send an invoice via email for almost free. If and when we&#8217;re making millions of dollars and have tons of customers and it costs us more to generate the invoices than just pay the 3%, then sure, we can start doing credit cards OR if there is some cash conversion cycle benefit at work.

So we agreed to ditch the credit card billing stuff which is good &#8211; it frees up development time and can get the prototype / MVP out faster.

After that I spent some time talking with Jon and setting up an S3 bucket for his and Isaiah&#8217;s web front end. We found some older stuff out there from March that I had built initially and deleted it because we no longer needed it and you pay for what you use in AWS. After that I moved on to getting some updates written here, re-heated some left over rack of lamb from the other day so I could eat lunch while I worked, and took a minute to change the laundry.

Tom called about then and he and I chatted for 20 minutes &#8211; mostly just bullshitting &#8211; while I ate. After he and I hung up, I went back to writing here. I really want to get this stuff back up to date.

Life, it seems, has a sense of satire and irony. I got a panicked ping on Slack from Jon at 3:33PM that said &#8220;call me&#8221;. That type of message is never good. So I called him and he basically said &#8220;I&#8217;m an idiot. I deleted the CodeCommit repository.&#8221; In layman&#8217;s terms what he was saying was:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    <strong><em>&#8220;HOLY FUCK I JUST DELETED ALL THE CODE WE&#8217;VE WRITTEN FOR OUR PRODUCT!!!&#8221;</em></strong>
  </p>
  
  <cite>Jon</cite>
</blockquote>

I was doubtful that it was truly deleted, but understood Jon&#8217;s near-panic meltdown. I didn&#8217;t think CodeCommit stored files in S3, and ultimately I was right, but there was a moment there where I was like &#8220;ok, just another problem to solve.&#8221; I must be getting better at managing my stress levels.

I put a call into Paul, he said he&#8217;d take a look later on over the weekend but wasn&#8217;t overly afraid since we had local backups on everyone&#8217;s PCs and that he&#8217;d ping me back later. I jumped on a Zoom meeting with Jon and did some screensharing to check the code repository &#8211; all the code was still there. Jon was still getting a &#8220;can&#8217;t find files message&#8221; but at least we knew it was on his side and not the central code repo. 

Life can be such a fickle bitch sometimes. Nice try, Life.

After that I went back to my writing here. Overall a good week. Things are moving so fast &#8211; it&#8217;s hard to keep it all in my head sometimes. My mood is generally positive, we&#8217;re making traction, and it&#8217;s amazing to see how much we&#8217;re changing week-over-week. I don&#8217;t have much of a history to compare it to, but it seems like we&#8217;re making pretty good progress. 

Ohh, and Apple is up like 10% today after a really strong earnings report yesterday. My bank account needs that love &#8211; I&#8217;m almost out of money in savings so I&#8217;ll need to start tapping into my stock account in the next couple of weeks. I think out of all the stressors, money is the biggest one.
