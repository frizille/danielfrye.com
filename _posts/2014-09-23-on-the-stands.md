Tonight Chris and Jimmy came over to help get the car moved. With two of us in the back and one up front we got it lifted off the crate and onto jack stands. I had some extra microfiber rags and placed those between the chassis and the jack stands to protect the chassis from being scratched. After getting it moved, we bullshitted in the garage a bit, liberated a couple beers from the fridge, and wrapped up the night with not much more progress than that.
