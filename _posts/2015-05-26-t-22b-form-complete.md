With the car almost done, I started lining up the things I need to get the tags and title applied for. After do a bunch of reading online and talking to other folks I determined in the State of Georgia I needed three things to get my tags:

1. MV-1 form which is the tag application.

2. T-22B form completed and signed off by a local law enforcement officer stating the car wasn&#8217;t stolen and the VIN checks out.

3. Proof of insurance.

With that in mind, the MV-1 form was easy and filled that out online. Insurance was equally easy; quick call to Hagerty and the car was insured. The T-22B was a little more involved since it required a local law enforcement officer to come out and review it. After putting it off for a few days, I called the local police precinct and asked them about doing the VIN check for the T-22B form. The precinct said I had 2 options; a) call 911 for a non-emergency call and have them come out or b) drive the car up to the precinct for them to do the VIN check. Since the car isn&#8217;t driveable the choice was easy&#8230;

After talking to the 911 operator, which always makes me nervous, they sent out a police officer to check the VIN. Even though it was a non-emergency call, they were at the house within 20 minutes or so. That&#8217;s pretty impressive. The officer was a nice guy, we chatted about cars a little bit, and then he did the VIN check and it came back not found (of course, it&#8217;s never been registered). With that done he signed off on the form and the T-22B was finished.

Off to the DMV in the morning for tags&#8230;
