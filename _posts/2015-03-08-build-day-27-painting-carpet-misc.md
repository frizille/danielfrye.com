First step of the day was to drill out the radiator brackets with a 5/16 to fit oil cooler bolts. I positioned the radiator on the bench, hit it with the drill, and viola! new holes in place. Next up was to take it outside and give it a makeover. I wasn&#8217;t thrilled with the standard aluminum color in combination with the black pack on the car so got a rattle can of high temp engine spray paint in flat black. First 2 coats went on ok, and I&#8217;m like &#8220;this painting thing is EASY&#8221;, and the third coat turned into a runny mess. I&#8217;ll need to pick up some 220 or 400 grit sandpaper and even it out later on (crap).

Once I had a couple coats down &#8211; that stuff dries quick in the sun &#8211; I moved on to the boot board. I took it out of the car, 5 self tapping screws, and gave it a good coat with some clear polyurethane I picked up at Home Depot. It says 3 hours between coats and planned on 2 coats each side.

While the radiator was drying, I looked at fitting the knee panels. As others have stated, the holes weren&#8217;t even close. Why do they drill these out if they don&#8217;t line up? something to deal with later when I have more hands to help hold stuff.

[<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-873" src="http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-08-15.28.25.jpg" alt="Knee panel doesn't line up" width="4128" height="2322" srcset="http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-08-15.28.25.jpg 4128w, http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-08-15.28.25-300x169.jpg 300w, http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-08-15.28.25-768x432.jpg 768w, http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-08-15.28.25-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-08-15.28.25-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 4128px) 100vw, 4128px" />](http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-08-15.28.25.jpg)

After the expected knee panel discovery I moved onto the carpet in the boot. I&#8217;d stopped earlier part way through so went ahead and put in the corners and back boot carpet. I did not glue this in with carpet adhesive like I did elsewhere; everything seemed to fit (very) tight and actually had to trim the corners a tiny bit to fit around the rear stanchions.

After the carpet was done I moved onto the engine wiring. After trying it multiple ways &#8211; multiple times &#8211; I arrived at the conviction I&#8217;m missing something. Only a few plugs line up or attach to anything. Another email to Caterham I guess.

[<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-877" src="http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-08-18.00.02.jpg" alt="Missing harnesses?" width="4128" height="2322" srcset="http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-08-18.00.02.jpg 4128w, http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-08-18.00.02-300x169.jpg 300w, http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-08-18.00.02-768x432.jpg 768w, http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-08-18.00.02-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-08-18.00.02-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 4128px) 100vw, 4128px" />](http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-08-18.00.02.jpg)

With the wiring stalled, I moved onto attaching the oil pressure sender (I think that&#8217;s it) to the oil pan. Easy and straightforward. I torqued it down to tight and then a little more; still seems like it should go in further but it&#8217;s in there damn tight now.

[<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-875" src="http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-08-16.33.13.jpg" alt="Oil pressure sender" width="4128" height="2322" srcset="http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-08-16.33.13.jpg 4128w, http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-08-16.33.13-300x169.jpg 300w, http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-08-16.33.13-768x432.jpg 768w, http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-08-16.33.13-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-08-16.33.13-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 4128px) 100vw, 4128px" />](http://danielfrye.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-08-16.33.13.jpg)

After that, I moved onto the breather line and coolant return. After reading some build blogs I decided to run down the right side of the engine with the P clips provided. I ended up needing a couple extras so went to Home Depot for a couple more; they were like $2.

With that done I called it a day. Not as much as I was hoping to get done, but parts shortages have a habit of pacing things slowly.
