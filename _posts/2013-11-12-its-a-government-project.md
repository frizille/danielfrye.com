Today I received the invoice for the build. Like renovating the kitchen in my old house, my last major project where I was over budget by almost double, I’m on par here too. I’m 25% over budget and haven’t purchased the motor or the gearbox yet. Which is understandable. If someone made you pick between the upgraded brakes, the limited slip differential, the wide track suspension, the wheels you want, or the paint color you’re absolutely in love with you’d probably just do the same thing I did. What’s that saying? For everything in life there’s Visa?
