Adam, Venice, and Heather came by this morning for a bit to help me square up some things with the car. I was hoping to start the engine, but missing the ground plug for the submarine piece and a few other bits I was unsure of meant we had to delay. Meanwhile, we set about torquing in the rear suspension and giving it a final once over. Not too many pictures since there&#8217;s not much new to report, but the rear was all done properly and we spent a good hour going over everything again.

The one fix / change was to the speedo gear (which I knew about before and had on my punch list). Prior we&#8217;d attached the bracket but the sensor wasn&#8217;t over the cog&#8217;d wheel quite right. I&#8217;d read on another build blog to add a washer between the DeDion ear and the speedo sensor bracket to align it better. We took everything off, a bit of a pain, and then added a washer to the top and bottom bolt. It aligns much better now!

Before:

After:

After that, we fiddled with the engine and moved the cam cover breather tube from the breather bottle to the air box. This involved moving taking apart a lot of the cam cover bolts, re-routing a few things, but was all fairly common sense (for someone who&#8217;s moved the hoses 10 times so far). Final routing looks like the following pic.

Once done we decided to stop there. I was tired from the marathon yesterday and Princess Tiny Pants (Venice) decided it was time for some Burrito La Parilla, cheese dip, and a nap. It was a productive weekend &#8211; feels good to tackle a few challenges and overcome them!
