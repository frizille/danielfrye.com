Discovered last night, after giving the manual and some build blogs a read that I&#8217;m missing the oil breather bottle and its mounting bracket. From other build blogs it seems this is a common occurrence. Emailed Derek at Caterham UK for the parts. Also inquired about the spare wheel and MCO paperwork I&#8217;m still waiting on.

It&#8217;s been almost 6 months since the car showed up and almost 18 months since I ordered it. Maybe I just got up on the wrong side of the bed this morning, butÂ I&#8217;m becoming increasingly frustrated with a 40 year old car company which can&#8217;t produce a wheel or print off some paperwork and drop it in the post in a reasonable amount of time.
