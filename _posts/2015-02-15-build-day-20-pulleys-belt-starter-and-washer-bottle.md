It was back to the garage full steam now that Valentine&#8217;s Day was over. I started the day with tightening down the pulleys so I could move onto the cooling system. These were much more difficult to do than I anticipated and realized I need the right tools. A quick trip to Sears for a strap wrench was a good choice; things went much quicker afterwards. Water pulley tightened and then moved onto the idler pulley (finger pointing to it, I think its the idler pulley) which turned out to be an issue. The pulley would spin, but required a lot of force to do so.

I was in a bit of a panic at this point since I felt maybe I&#8217;d done something wrong, but the issueÂ turned out to be the bottom bolt from the mounting bracket wasn&#8217;t sunk in far enough and was dragging on the pulley.

Fix was easy; backed out the pulley, the bolt, removed the spring washer, and added loctite then put it all back together. Pulley worked fine after that &#8211; it just needed that extra 1mm of depth. Next up was the belt. I&#8217;d read on [Andrew Bissell&#8217;s blog](http://caterhamsevenbuild.blogspot.com/) to turn the top right tensioner bolt counter-clockwise with a 17mm socket then attach the belt. It worked perfect.

Next up was attaching the starter.

Torque specs between the Ford Hayne&#8217;s manual and the Caterham manual were different &#8211; I ended up torquing to the 35 NM required by the Caterham manual (with flat and crush washers under the bolts once I realized I needed them). Pic without the washers&#8230;

Once the starter was on (twice) I cleaned up the washer bottle bracket and re-routed the washer&#8217;s clear plastic tube, zip tied it in place, and attached to the washer motor&#8230; only to realize I&#8217;d not routed it past the clutch cylinder how I wanted. I cut everything off, fiddled with the washer bottle to get the clear plastic tube off which was a big pain in the ass, then re-ran it. A lot of fiddling for probably nothing, but wanted it a certain way.

Next up I took off this metal tube thing in the middle of the pic below &#8211; no idea what it is &#8211; but the general consensus from other build blogs and a chat with Randy was it isn&#8217;t needed.
