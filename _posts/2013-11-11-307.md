Itâ€™s about 2am and I canâ€™t stop reading build blogs looking for those little hidden nuggets of knowledge that will make this project successful. Iâ€™m starting to get nervous about this grand adventure â€“ like any project, Iâ€™m already about ten grand over my budget. And I donâ€™t even have anything tangible yet. But anything worth doing is worth doing the way you want it and of course I just have to be the first kid on my block with a car thatâ€™ll make grown men weep and women ask why in godâ€™s name it doesnâ€™t have an air conditioner, a radio, or a windshield.

Anyway, so I was reading these build blogs and found this one blog from a group of kids in the UK. Apparently they have some kind of charity project for high school kids to build a Caterham; thatâ€™s cool stuff. The build blog was scant on details, but what I found awesome in there was a picture of the coveralls the kids got â€“ it had their name and the Super 7 logo embroidered on the breast pocket!

Like I said, I was searching for hidden gemsâ€¦ so yeahâ€¦ I need to order some coveralls. ðŸ™‚
