Derek emailed me over some pictures of the throttle cable setup. Not entirely applicable because my bracket is machined backwards, but at least I know how it is supposed to be. Posting the best one here in case its helpful for anyone else. More importantly, he said the wiring harness I need for the coil plugs and the alternator are on the way.

What I also got today from Caterham was the missing Manufacturer Certificate of Origination (MCO) paperwork. Thanks to Caroline at Caterham for chasing that down and sending it over. Now that the paperwork is here I can start working on filing out the tag forms and get insurance&#8230;. then just need to get the car done. It&#8217;s getting closer.
