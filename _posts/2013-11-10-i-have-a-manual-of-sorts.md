I stumbled onto a blog site and managed to find an older copy of the Caterham build manual. It’s a decade old, so won’t match my revision, but reading it has been helpful to grasp the scale of this project. As I was reading through it kind of hit me … “holy shit, I’m building a car”. Like… holy shit. A little in awe, a lot worried I’m gonna break something important (read that as expensive), but ehhhh… it’ll all come together in the end. Putting this thing together isn’t a race… it’s more like an experience. So with that in mind, my goal isn’t just to build the car, but to document the experience of it.

I was talking to one of the guys I work with a couple days ago and he mentioned he’d love to be able to watch the project remotely as it all comes together so I needed to take lots of pictures. I promised him I would and I guess that’s kind of the point to the build blog. It transforms one man’s journey into a spectator sport comprised of 99% men. Kind of like car racing.
