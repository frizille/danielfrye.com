After a few hours sleep I headed back down to the garage to regroup. Progress was much slower on Friday night than I&#8217;d hoped for; largely because it was a learning experience in many intangible ways. Or what I hope will be tangible as I go along. Finding bolts in the bolt packs is a little daunting at first, but as you do it more you start to look at it with much less uncertainty. Ironically enough, after a few hours I was picking out bolts and identifying them by size, &#8216;M8 x 25 cap head bolt&#8217; and boom, there it is.

As I was getting organized to start the headlights, I noticed the GoPro was out of batteries &#8211; again! When I was working Friday night it would run dry after about an hour and a half. A little peeved, I broke out the drill and a 1/2&#8243; drill bit and put a hole through the case. It wasn&#8217;t quite the right size, so broke out the dremel and opened it up a bit more and viola! I now have a hole for the power so I can just leave it plugged in all the time.

With the GoPro problem solved, it was onto the headlights so I could attach them to the upper wishbones and get them bolted in. I&#8217;d read somewhere, I think maybe it was in the manual or might have been a build blog, that its much easier to get the wires run properly if they&#8217;re done at the same time as the upper wishbones.

And that&#8217;s where I hit my first really frustrating point. Before, when I was working the suspension, it was fairly straightforward. The couple missteps I had Friday were because I was trying to learn the manual, learn the build process, and kind of figure things out as I went. I&#8217;ve worked on cars for a few years and can confidently say taking things apart and putting them back together the same way is pretty easy; following a paragraph of descriptive &#8216;English&#8217;, finding bolts (which may or may not be missing), and a diagram which does NOT match your setup in any meaningful way fundamentally slows (or halts) forward progress. I lack patience. I&#8217;ll be the first to admit it. This process is not for those who lack patience &#8211; you will be frustrated and pissed off very quickly. But I&#8217;m learning; perhaps this build-a-car-thing will enable me to improve an important life skill?

Now that I&#8217;ve waxed poetic, time to get back to the headlights. First step was to get the turn indicators mounted into the rubber rings and get the lenses put back on.

Once I got the indicator together I noticed the metal rings weren&#8217;t black as they should be. A quick search online revealed they should be; will have to address that with some black spray paint at some point.

After reading through the instructions a few times I couldn&#8217;t make heads or tails of the indicator wiring. I got the indicator mounted to the headlight housing easily enough, but the wiring on the indicator has bullet connectors on it while the manual says the black wire, which doesn&#8217;t exist as I&#8217;ve got just a red and brown wire, should connect to the headlight housing via a ring terminal and the red wire should go to the wiring harness with the other wires. I&#8217;ll have to table that for a bit until I can figure it out.

Since the headlight was on hold I went ahead and tackled the damper install. It was straightforward; essentially you pull out the bolt that comes shipped in the upper chassis mount and the one shipped in the lower wishbone. The upper one can be a bit of a pain in the ass. The body frame and aluminum sheet metal make for tight clearances and its hard getting an allen wrench in there. A little patience and finger work to get it out. Once out, insert the bushings in the upper and lower damper mount, along with a healthy dose of anti-sieze, and then assemble. A quick torque to 20nm and you&#8217;re done. Just don&#8217;t forget to torque down the upper wishbone first&#8230; you can&#8217;t get to the bolt once you get the damper in. I know from experience.

With that done I called it a day to go figure out the headlight wiring.
