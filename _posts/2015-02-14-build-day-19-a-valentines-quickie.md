Kim and I made a trip to Home Depot in the morning and acquired a temporary bolt for the alternator (waiting on Derek from Caterham UK to send me parts) and a vice so I could get the 13mm nut loose on the horns. I bought myself a nice 6&#8243; vice which did the trick magnificently. Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day to me!

Kim was gracious enough to indulge me for 5 minutes to help hold the vice so I could get the nuts off; I&#8217;ll drill out the workbench and mount it properly eventually. After that we stopped &#8211; it was Valentines and wanted to give her attention for the day&#8230;

&#8230; but then Kim fell asleep on the couch and I sneaked down to the garage. ðŸ™‚Â I got the horns on the chassis before my absence was discovered and put my tools down for the day.
