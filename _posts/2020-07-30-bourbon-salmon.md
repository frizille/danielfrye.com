A friend recently got a new Kamado Joe and made his inaugural cook a bourbon salmon. He passed along a copy to me to try since Kim loves salmon.

This is his recipe:

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brine </span>**

  * 2 Tbsp kosher salt
  * 1 Tbsp brown sugar
  * 1/2 tsp onion powder
  * 1/2 tsp ground pepper
  * 3/4 cup water
  * 1/4 cup bourbon

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Glaze </span>**

  * 3 Tbsp honey
  * 1 Tbsp orange juice
  * 1 Tbsp orange zest
  * 1 tsp bourbon 
  * Fresh thyme, leaves from a few sprigs, to taste (Note: I forgot to add the bourbon to the glaze. Still good. )

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Directions</span>**

Mix the brine and let the fish marinate for one hour. Remove and then pat it dry with paper towels.

Get the grill going at 250 degrees F, grate temp, with heat deflectors in place. Put in a couple chunks of apple wood. Cook fish for for about 30-45 minutes or until it hits 140. USDA says to cook salmon to 145, but that&#8217;s a bit too well done for me.

Brush on glaze during last 5-10 minutes of cook or when it gets to about 125 degrees F.

Richard&#8217;s recommendation: Reduce salt and increase sugar to about 50/50. I used a farm raised salmon filet, just over an inch thick. Thinner fillets may take less time to avoid drying.
