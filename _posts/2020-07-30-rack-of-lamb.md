This was a pretty simple recipe and a fairly easy cook. I modified it from [here](https://www.biggreenegg.eu/en/inspiration/recipes/grilled-rack-of-lamb). I picked up the racks at Costco, it was about $20 per rack of about 1.5 lb. 

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ingredients</span>**

  * 2 racks of lamb
  * 1/2 sprig of Rosemary (chopped)
  * 1/2 sprig of Thyme (chopped)
  * Sea salt
  * 6 cloves of Garlic (crushed)
  * Yellow or Dijon Mustard

Directions

  1. Fire up the grill to about 350-400, direct heat. I ran mine consistently at 400-420 and had no issues. I added one small piece of cherry wood, about the size of half a pack of cigarettes, once the coals were established and right before I put the lamb on.
  2. While the fire was getting up to temp, I slathered Dijon mustard on the outsides of the lamb (on the top where the meat is, I didn&#8217;t do any underneath), chopped up the rosemary, and chopped up the thyme. If I was using garlic I&#8217;d have chopped that up too.
  3. I then sprinkled the rosemary, thyme, and salt on the meat. Salt was about 2 pinches of salt per rack, spread evenly. Rosemary and thyme were put on a medium amount, about 1/4 sprig each rack. 
  4. I skipped the garlic entirely since I&#8217;m allergic to it, but used Dijon instead of yellow mustard so the meat had a little more flavor. I&#8217;m sure it tastes great with garlic, but that&#8217;s a no go for me. 
  5. I let it sit for ~20 minutes on the counter before the grill got up to temp.
  6. Put the meat on the grill, meat side down. Close the lid and let it sit for about 3 minutes. 
  7. After those 3 minutes are up, rotate the meat up to a 45 degree angle, and let the bones rest on each other, kind of like when you form a steeple with your fingers. Let it cook this way for another 3 minutes with the lid closed.
  8. After those 3 minutes are up, flip the meat over so they are bone side down / meat side out, and then stand them up and lean them against each other. If you want to get really snazzy with it, then interlock the bones.
  9. Cook the meat to 130 degrees F for a medium-rare (more on the medium side) and then let it rest for 5-10 minutes under a foil tent.

And that&#8217;s it. Pretty easy and straight forward, prep time is quick, so it makes a pretty simple mid-week meal when you don&#8217;t have hours to tend the smoker.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">
