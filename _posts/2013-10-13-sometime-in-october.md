Car is ordered and now … we wait. Patience is hard. I have none. I spend my idle time clearing out garbage from the garage, playing the stock market to buffer my cost overruns I know are coming, and googling “Caterham build blog” about twice a week. I’ve read most of them on the internet in some fashion.

Late at night, when I think everyone is asleep, I pull out my iPad and just stare at pictures of them. I’m turning into a narcissist.
