Tonight after going out for some La Parilla, Kim and I finished the parts inventory from the manual (using latest I could download from Caterham, Nov 2013) and emailed Jon at Caterham USA about what&#8217;s missing and my questions.

Here&#8217;s what it looks like I&#8217;m missing and/or need clarification on:

  * Spare wheel w/ associated fasteners, center caps, center cap badges, etc.
  * Gearbox fastener pack ZGB14 says its for a K-Series engine; I&#8217;ll be using the Duratec engine so not sure if this is the right fastener pack or not.
  * Driveshaft nyloc nuts &#8211; I see two nyloc nuts on there but both are white and the manual says one white and one green. Asked Jon about what I should have.
  * Fastener pack for the suspension in the manual is 30R012A, I got 30R012C. I&#8217;m assuming its correct but didn&#8217;t match the manual so wanted to ask.
  * Missing lower wishbone left hand side, wide track. Of all the things I&#8217;m missing this one is the most important as it&#8217;s one of the first things that goes on.
  * There&#8217;s no SVA bag; I&#8217;m assuming there is nothing in there I need since I&#8217;m not in the UK but wanted to validate.
  * I&#8217;ve got an extra bag of random parts &#8211; aero whiskers, clutch line, screws, washers, nuts &#8211; and think it might be Simon&#8217;s (the owner of the red Superlight I got by accident) because I found a bottle of red touch up paint in the bag with his build number on it. I&#8217;ve got his address (from the side of the box) and can send it his way. Similarly, I think he&#8217;s got mine as I&#8217;m missing the fuel filler cover, wiper blades, wiper arms, transmission tunnel cover, IVA trim, velcro strips, green touch up paint, fastener packs 30P106A, ZCH, and ZWE &#8211; essentially everything from page 43 of the manual that was shipped loose in the car.
  * I&#8217;ve got a ton of Ford parts with no parts manifest. I asked Jon if Caterham has one so I can inventory those boxes. The big things I can think of are in there, but wanted to see what I should have because I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a million little nuts, bolts, random bits I&#8217;ll need.

Overall, the inventory task wasn&#8217;t too bad. Things were together in boxes by function, i.e. suspension, engine, lighting, weather gear, etc. and Kim was down there helping me so went pretty quick &#8211; with both of us I think we knocked it out in about 2 hours. The problem was the manual was pretty spotty on the polythene bags &#8211; it just says &#8220;suspension polythene bag&#8221; and you take it at face value the polythene bag has what you need. I&#8217;ve got to see if Caterham has a parts database for every part number &#8211; that&#8217;d be really helpful. And no parts inventory for the engine; it&#8217;s like a big black hole mystery right now what the heck I need to do with that thing and all the ancillaries but will cross that gap when I get there.
