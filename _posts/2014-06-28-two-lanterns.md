For some reason I&#8217;m reminded of Paul Revere&#8217;s famous quote &#8220;one if by land, two if by sea&#8221;. It&#8217;s meaning should be obvious&#8230; the car is on the boat! The &#8216;STUTTGART EXPRESS&#8217; left Southampton on June 23rd, bound for Antwerp, Bremerhaven, and Le Havre in Europe before a 12 day journey across the Atlantic to Veracruz and Altamira Mexico, then a 1 day jaunt to Houston for unloading. From there it&#8217;ll be a truck or train to Caterham USA in Denver, and then, finally, a truck to Atlanta.

Its been just under a year, I ordered on August 27th, 2013, but seems like just yesterday. Well&#8230; maybe not yesterday. More like last month. But certainly doesn&#8217;t feel like _last year_. Lately I&#8217;ve been asking myself &#8220;what should I be doing?&#8221;. I mean, right after I ordered it was like feverish activity &#8211; download the manual, work on strengthening my back so I can actually build this thing, get the garage done, put up insulation, put up drywall, paint, get cabinets, get flooring, get tools, read about actually building a car, read the manual (at least twice)&#8230; it was like non-stop neverending &#8230; stuff. But now, the garage is mostly done, I&#8217;m kind of like ok&#8230; what next&#8230; but haven&#8217;t got it cracked. I mean, maybe do some painting&#8230; I guess. It&#8217;s kind of funny &#8211; I was this whirling dervish of activity but now I want to say I&#8217;ve settled into my stride&#8230; its just about enjoying it, rather than &#8220;zomg I gotta get shit done!&#8221;.

But I still stalk this thing via the ASIS marine GPS systems on the internet. ðŸ™‚
