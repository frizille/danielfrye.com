After my last post I figured it was time to bring in reinforcements. A number of Lotus guys recommended I get in touch with Jeremy Buckingham at Buckingham Automotive and have him take a look at the oil pan. The speedo, fuel gauge, and idle issue are all &#8220;non critical&#8221; in the sense that you can still drive the car, however, having oil in the engine is a bit of a prerequisite and had to get solved. At their suggestion, I got in touch with Jeremy and on a chilly October morning topped up the oil and took the Caterham up to Jeremy. Jeremy&#8217;s an ex-F1 mechanic with years of racing experience and access to a full machine shop &#8211; if he couldn&#8217;t get it fixed nobody could.

Jeremy quickly reported back that the oil pan had a bit of a wave in it and some scoring marks so he re-machined the lip so it was flat and true then resealed it. After 72 hours he confirmed no leaking and the car was ready to go. He also poked around a bit with it to validate the build and gave it his stamp of approval. Having someone who used to do quality assurance on F1 race cars say you did a &#8220;great job on your build&#8221; (that&#8217;s a direct quote) is kind of like your kid getting accepted into MIT.

Then the rain set in. For 2 weeks. Every. Single. Day. And each day I&#8217;d dream of actually going to get the car and driving it.

Finally, on Friday, November 13th, about 12:30 in the afternoon it was a fabulous 65 degrees (F) and I was able to clear my work calendar enough to go pick it up. I then enjoyed an hour and a half blat during my lunch break to get the car from Jeremy&#8217;s shop to the house. The weather was perfect &#8211; you could smell the leaves in the fall air&#8230; right until I got behind a garbage truck for 3 miles.

So in summary, the car is home, oil pan is fixed, and Jeremy is A-class &#8211; highly recommended for anyone in the Atlanta area who needs vintage race car prep or work on their Caterham or Lotus.
