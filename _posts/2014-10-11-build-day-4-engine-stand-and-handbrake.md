It&#8217;s been two weeks since I&#8217;ve been able to get some time on the car due to work trips. The few times I&#8217;ve been home, I keep thinking that single headlight is staring at me in the same way a half completed monster would fondly gaze at Victor Frankenstein in the hope it would be completed. But the suspension still is not here yet and I&#8217;ve got no word from Jon at Caterham USA on when it will arrive.

In the meantime, I&#8217;ve got an engine stand I picked up at Harbor Freight for $50 to assemble and can&#8217;t think of a reason not to tackle something simple to get myself going again. Assembly is easy; few bolts here and there and viola&#8217;, we now have an engine stand.

Once the engine stand was done, I started tinkering with the hand brake cables. Assembly was straight forward, although I&#8217;ve discovered I&#8217;m missing the thick clevis pin. When reading build blogs to figure out the headlights, I remembered seeing someone else missing theirs. I did a quick double check and sure enough &#8211; numerous other folks were missing theirs. Seems like an odd part to be missing, I mean, it&#8217;s just a metal dowel and can&#8217;t be that complicated to make. Another note &#8211; the clevis and some of the handbrake parts seem very sloppily made. They don&#8217;t quite line up, the thin clevis didn&#8217;t quite fit (rubber mallet solved that pretty easily), and in general just seemed&#8230; messy. But it seems to work, or will I should say, once the thick clevis pin gets here. I sent an email to Jon at Caterham letting him know I needed that as well. I also followed up on the suspension to get an ETA for those parts &#8211; it&#8217;s been almost 7 weeks and no closer to getting them than before.

A quick picture of the handbrake assembly loosely fit into the transmission tunnel and I called it a day. The diff will have to wait until I&#8217;ve got more hands and want to read up on it a bit more before I try to tackle it.
