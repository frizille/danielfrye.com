Today is the day! I sent the check, receipt confirmed, and I’ve now got a deposit on a build slot in December 2013 with delivery sometime in early 2014. Final build is:

  * Ford 2.0L Duratec (~175 HP)
  * Limited slip differential
  * Standard S3 chassis
  * Ventilated front discs & quad piston calipers
  * 15” wheels / Avon CR500 tyres 7”f + 7”r including superlight suspension
  * Weather equipment & carbon interchangeable aeroscreen
  * Black Pack
  * Black aero filler cap
  * Spare wheel & carrier
  * Push button start
  * 12 volt power socket
  * Trackday rollover bar
  * Race harnesses

And then there’s the paint. Caterham F1 green with a yellow noseband and bonnet stripe. Looks kinda like this …

All-in-all I know I overspent. But I figure if you’re going to the trouble of actually _building a car_ then by god I’m going to _build the one I want!_
