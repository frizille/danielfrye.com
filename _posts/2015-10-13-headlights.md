I&#8217;ve been putting off the headlights for a while just because I wasn&#8217;t planning on driving at night and was preoccupied with getting more serious matters fixed. However, I registered for the Caffeine and Exotics event this coming weekend and was going to need functioning headlights as I&#8217;d be required to leave the house before sunrise. That led me to putting some time aside tonight to get the headlights wired up and I&#8217;m happy to say it was a lot less painful than I expected.

First off, the instructions from Caterham are not correct for a US car as the lights here useÂ a two filament bulb whereas they are single filament in the UK. That means we end up with a red (hot) and brown (hot) wire while the UK gets a red (hot) and black (ground). You can see the problem here &#8211; no ground and both wires are hot in the US.

The correct method for US cars is to:

  1. Extend the red wire from the indicator to the 6-pin automotive connector in engine bay.
  2. Attach the brown wire to the small bulb in the headlight.
  3. Add a 3rd wire (black) as your ground from the turn indicator to the headlight bowl and secure with a terminal ring.
  4. The indicator on the front cycle wings then attaches into the automotive connector.

I didn&#8217;t do that &#8211; I just went with the UK way of wiring things up. What I ended up doing, and it works just fine, is to terminate the brown wire to the headlight bowl with a terminal ring and then extend the red wire to the 6-pin connector in the engine bay.

Why? Well, to start with I didn&#8217;t use the side indicators on the front cycle wings since I liked the look better without them. Jon (Caterham USA) told me many folks don&#8217;t use them and opt to leave them off so I wasn&#8217;t alone in this feeling. Second, the use of the indicator as a side light doesn&#8217;t measurably help in any way so why bother? Third, I&#8217;d already wired the car up according to the manual because months ago I didn&#8217;t know the manual was wrong, surprise surprise right?

After 30 minutes or so to open the headlight bowls, plug in the connectors, and check the lights &#8211; viola! Working lights and blinkers.

I then adjusted them as best I was able in the garage using the instructions in the manual and called it a night.
