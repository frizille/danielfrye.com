A little news out of the Caterham camp &#8211; the manuals are being redesigned. If you&#8217;ve read through my build blog you&#8217;ll remember there were numerous challenges with the manual, namely there&#8217;s no instructions for the motor build up and it was confusing in some parts due to the varying degrees of detail and lack of a picture reference. The new manual is reminiscent of how Lego does theirs &#8211; heavy on pictures and icons and short on text. That&#8217;s perfect in my opinion. You can get a copy of the beta manual, which is just the front suspension steps and about 20 pages so far, from Caterham&#8217;s support site.

Additionally, the non-beta &#8220;official&#8221; manual is up to &#8216;version 02.2015**c**&#8216;. It says Feb 2015 on the cover page, which is the same as the non-&#8220;**c**&#8221; version I built my car with, so I&#8217;m not sure when it was actually released and there&#8217;s no change log in the manual so don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s different.

For comparison sake, here&#8217;s a picture of theÂ old and new manuals.
