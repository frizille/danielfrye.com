#### Monday, June 22, 2020

Monday was a complete waste. I spent all day reading about Open ID Connect (OIDC), Open Authorization 1.0 (OAUTH 1.0), Open Authorization 2.0 (OAUTH 2.0), and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). The goal was to try to make heads or tails of it and figure out how we code to those standards for authentication federation. 

It sounds very simple until you [go read about it](https://openid.net/developers/specs/). Then it becomes confusing quickly. Trying to wrap my head around it was a total failure so I said ok, I just need some sample code to walk through. After pulling some down after a Google search&#8230; I was just as lost. So the day ended up nowhere except in circles.

I was pretty frustrated after Monday. I had higher expectations that it would just click, but it didn&#8217;t. And then I started beating myself up because of it. My mood was pretty foul Monday night, but resolved that I would just need to figure it out because there really wasn&#8217;t any other option.

On Tuesday, I spent four hours working with Ben to create a diagram of how we thought the authentication flow needed to work. We spent a great deal of that time chatting through the OIDC framework. The great news was that by talking to Ben about it and bouncing ideas off each other, we ended up getting MUCH farther than I was able to get by myself on Monday. 

The loss of Monday grated on me, however, it made me realize that I can&#8217;t do this alone and need to rely on really smart people to help. I mean, I knew that already, but this was one of those moments that poignantly reinforces that knowledge. 

We ended up pushing our Tuesday night meeting as we really didn&#8217;t have much to cover.

Paul came down on Wednesday so we could work face to face. Kim had some concerns about COVID, but Paul&#8217;s been careful and so have we so, figured it&#8217;d be ok. Paul and I did the 10AM meeting with Ben then spent a good deal of time talking about culture. We ended up going to get mexican for lunch. On the way there, Paul commented about settling into an executive role.

That was interesting to me because I view him and Tom as peers. It never occurred to me that neither of them have worked at the Director level or higher. I&#8217;m the only one that&#8217;s presented to a Board of Directors and the only one that&#8217;s operated at a multi-national executive level. I gave it some thought and I think that because I see them as peers, I often (always) forget that the experiences I take for granted they have never had. The conversation with Paul made me realize that I need to mentor Tom and Paul so they can get the experiences I have been able to have and, if possible, find them some advisors or mentors within their disciplines, CFO and CTO respectively.

I also started thinking in a broader sense about culture. It occurred to me that one of the things that Crestone had going for it in its early days was a very strong culture, centered around the Crestone Coin. 

The Crestone Coin will always be something I treasure. The coin was a simple metal coin, about half dollar in size, that had the company&#8217;s values printed on one side and a monogram of the mountain along with your employee number on the side. The rule was that you carried your coin with you, and if you didn&#8217;t have it and were challenged by another employee, you bought the drinks. It was extremely successful for a couple reasons:

  1. It was a physical manifestation of abstract values. Many companies have their &#8220;values&#8221;, but they usually stay on a piece of paper and are easily passed into irrelevance. The Crestone Coin made them something you held in your hand and carried with you.
  2. The &#8220;who pays for drinks challenge&#8221; made the company&#8217;s values part of its social norms. In a company where almost every person traveled extensively from project to project, it was an easy ice breaker for the new person on the project. 
  3. The coin reinforced the way that the company&#8217;s founders&#8217; wanted its employees to make their decisions (Client > Consultant > Company > Competitors). By aligning decision making rationale among its employees, in an environment that was highly decentralized given that it was largely a services / consulting business, the company was able to achieve a higher number of successful outcomes because the employees were making decisions the way the founders, who had the know-how, wanted them made. The founders were essentially able to delegate decision making broadly across the firm through the coin.

The Crestone Coin was genius. It was foundational in the early days of the company because it created an espirit de corp that wasn&#8217;t found anywhere else. I was employee #409 when I started with Crestone October 16, 2001. I still have my coin 19 years later.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

I pondered all this Wednesday afternoon as I did some work in the basement. I&#8217;ve generally found that hands on work, like cleaning the basement out or working in the yard, gives me the mental clarity I need to process deep topics.

Wednesday night I spent three hours on the phone with Tom talking revenue, incubators, and went through the &#8220;fuck, we&#8217;re going to fail cycle&#8221;, given all the unknowns we need to cross. Ironically, we also talked about culture. 

After I got off the phone with Tom, with the discussion between Paul and I in mind, I sat down and started crafting a bullet list of things I would want in a mission statement of sorts, or at least some form of culture guide we can use as we grow. Here&#8217;s what I came up with:

  1. Always seek to understand the customers&#8217; real pains and gains.
  2. Create opportunity that rewards an individual&#8217;s desire for growth.
  3. Challenge assumptions.
  4. Success is judged by action, not by hour.
  5. Don&#8217;t be an asshole.

At some point I&#8217;ll write up more of a mission statement, but think the above gets the general point across.

I took the day off Thursday to spend some time with my mom who was in town. We didn&#8217;t do much, just went to the mall to take her watches in, went to lunch, and really just caught up. It was nice to have a day off to not think about the company a bit. Note, I still spent a couple hours reading articles from the Startup School library and watching a couple of the Startup School curriculum videos. It didn&#8217;t feel like work though, so it&#8217;s hard for me to say I worked.

On Friday, I had an hour long chat with Kevin, a friend from my MBA program. It was a great chat. He&#8217;s moved on from the role he was in before at his prior company to be CEO of a health-tech startup. We have had a lot of similar experiences ranging from coming out of the program extremely burned out to the constant fear/worry that we&#8217;re going to really fuck up our companies. We also talked about our NSF proposal since he is planning to apply, gave him some pointers on how we approached it, and shared a copy of our proposal with him so he&#8217;d get a chance to see how we did it. 

Looking back, the week was amazing in many broad ways. It started horrifically with the OIDC challenge, I got regrouped and was successful on Tuesday with Ben&#8217;s help, was reminded of really important things I hadn&#8217;t consciously conceptualized on Wednesday, was reminded of life outside the company on Thursday, and on Friday was reminded that many other people are having similar experiences as I am and that everyone is more than happy to help support each other.

In terms of judging success or failure, the reality is that this experience can only be a win, and in many ways I&#8217;ve already won. I&#8217;m not the same person I was before and I learn every day.

This is by far the most rewarding job I&#8217;ve ever done in my life.
