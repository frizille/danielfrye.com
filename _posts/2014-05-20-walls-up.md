Got home from work tonight to find a lot of work had been done by the contractor today. Got the wall covering the storage area done, got the first bit of drywall up, and the electrical is mostly done. Â It&#8217;s coming together. And looks completely different with the drywall up; it looks almost like a room rather than a place to store dead zombies.
