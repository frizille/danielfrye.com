#### Monday, March 16, 2020

I honestly don&#8217;t remember much of the week in detail. My brain had two warring halves which oscillated between &#8220;holy shit, the stock market is in freefall and the money I need to launch this startup has now been cut in half&#8221; and &#8220;holy shit, I&#8217;m failing, we&#8217;re going to fail, I need to get this business model figured out&#8221;.

My mood was generally positive, all things considering, although I&#8217;m sure my wife would disagree. It&#8217;s self-evident that I&#8217;m biased of course.

Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday were meeting free and was heads down writing a business plan. As a diversion, I also did some creative work by writing a website of sorts just so we could get a little page out there with who we were. The website turned out pretty good, but realized Tuesday night that I was using the website &#8220;work&#8221; as a substitute for the harder, and more important, work of coming up with the business plan.

I chose to follow the business plan documenting model I&#8217;d done for my prior company when I did an evaluation of its AWS business right before I left. Essentially, the model is to take the nine-section CANVAS methodology and record the relevant details for each section in it. Customer segments, value proposition, cost model, revenue model, key resources, and so on. <figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

It&#8217;s a handy way to keep your mind focused on the respective quadrants of a business. All of them need to work in concert, so it&#8217;s easy to jump within the doc referencing separate sections as necessary and to edit / update / provide more detail as you build the business model.

The important thing here is that you aren&#8217;t just building the model off what you think, but that you&#8217;re referencing outside data to prove points. It&#8217;s a business model on one hand, but also a research paper of sorts on the other. I would argue that the research paper portion of it is more important than the business model, otherwise you&#8217;re in imagination land and your business will likely fail. Note, it&#8217;s sometimes hard to see where that line starts and stops &#8211; it&#8217;s a blurry image in most cases because you&#8217;re dealing with unpredictable events and humans.

Mike and I met for our first Zoom meeting of the year on Thursday. It was originally supposed to be over a beer, but the sudden and massive swell of Coronavirus events precluded that. Mike and I chatted for about an hour and I walked him through what I was thinking in terms of the business model, product, and how we&#8217;d go about reducing customer pain and providing new gains with our solution.

Mike&#8217;s feedback was that the business still felt a bit soft. I agreed with him once I got through an hours&#8217; worth of dialog with him. I felt like I should have things more solidified after spending the entire week trying to clearly articulate it in a document, and think I did feel rigidness in some respects, but there was a nagging feeling of mushiness there overall. I resolved to dig back into it on Friday and keep iterating.

Thursday night I got the chance to talk to one of the guys who used to work for me at my prior company. We worked together just shy of a decade and knew each other pretty well. He reminds me a lot of me. 

Given the pandemic, we had to cancel our beer in person and opted to chat via phone instead. It was good to catch up and chat. I didn&#8217;t really get to say goodbye when I left given my schedule and his, plus my head was somewhere else in trying to process the huge life change I was going through, but all&#8217;s well that ends well.

Interestingly, he told me that he was leaving the company as well. I wasn&#8217;t overly surprised. I suspected that he was ready to make a leap to something new a couple years ago but had settled into routine and that&#8217;s hard to break out of when you&#8217;re making a good-but-not-great salary, have a lot of flexibility with your hours and working remotely, and get to work on fun technical projects regularly.

I offered him what little advice I had from my journey these past few weeks, wished him well, and told him to stay in touch and holler if he ever needed anything. I also ordered him a copy of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Your-Life-Well-Lived-Joyful/dp/1101875321" target="_blank">Designing Your Life</a> on Amazon as a parting thank you gift for all the great work he&#8217;s done for me over the years thinking that it was helpful to me, and since he and I are a lot alike, might be useful for him too.

Friday I met with Cynthia, the executive recruiter from GA Tech, as a continuation of our conversation from the CDL event. She and I commented on how crazy things were, how life was about to change significantly for a lot of people _[EDIT: Hindsight 20/20, understatement of the year]_, and where I was with the business. She said I should reach out to a couple people in our MBA class that might be able to provide some good information and some contacts she had. I made some notes and would follow up with them in the coming weeks.

Overall, it was a pretty busy week and had high energy throughout. The pandemic stuff seems like its getting a bit nutty, surely it can&#8217;t be this bad and this is all overblown, but I guess it is what it is. At this point I&#8217;ve just accepted the stock market is going to be down a lot. I was somewhat fortunate that I sold out of Disney stock in January and put my money into Microsoft and Apple, thinking that surely they wouldn&#8217;t be dropping any time soon, but &#8230; oh well. 

I seem to be making progress on the business and the market will come back eventually.
